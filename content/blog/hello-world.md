# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using the new static site generator. The system supports:

- Markdown formatting
- Front matter for metadata
- Automatic date formatting
- Custom blog post template

## How to Create a Blog Post

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/blog` directory
2. Add front matter at the top with `title` and `date`
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Run the build script to generate the HTML

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Your Content Here
```

That's all you need to get started!
